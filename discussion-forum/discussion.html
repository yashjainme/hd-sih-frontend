                Wheat is susceptible to various diseases that can affect its yield and quality. Some common wheat diseases include rusts, powdery mildew, Fusarium head blight, and smuts. These diseases are often caused by fungi and can severely damage crops if not managed in time. Effective control measures include crop rotation, resistant varieties, and the use of fungicides.
